Bayesian Linear regression using MCMC and Variational Inference


Performed bayesian linear regression using the following 2 approaches:
Markov chain monte carlo based inference
Variational Inference


The error distribution is assumed to be guassian.

To demonstrate these methods, we use data containing 21 daily responses of stack loss, the amount of ammonia escaping, as a function of air flow, temperature, and acid concentration.
